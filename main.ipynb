    "This week, we will use a third party plotting framework called [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to visualize our plans. Please follow this [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/plotly-tutorial-for-beginners) to gain some basic experience with Plotly, and then come up with your own visualization function. You are free to choose to come up with your own visualization, and use something other than Plotly.\n",
