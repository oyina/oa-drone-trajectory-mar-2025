# Drone Flight Planner System: Flight Path for Efficient Data Capture.
 
Build Student Consultant, Computing and Data, The Build Fellowship, Completed June 03, 2025

* Completed a software development Build Project, "Drone Trajectory Planner," under the supervision of industry expert Ayush Baid.
* Developed core project components for camera modeling (e.g., project_world_point_to_image, compute_image_footprint_on_surface) and flight planning (e.g., compute_distance_between_images, generate_photo_plan_on_grid).
* Developed a Python-based drone trajectory planner model, which calculated and visually represented efficient flight paths for aerial photography.
* Performed regression testing to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the system, including analyzing the impact of changing parameters such as overlap, sidelap, height, and exposure time on flight plans and drone speed.
