Drone Trajectory Planner build project (March 2025) for open avenues foundation.
Build Student Consultant, Computing and Data
The Build Fellowship, 01/2024 â€“ 05/2024
Completed a software development Build Project, "Drone Trajectory Planner," under the supervision of industry expert Ed Sioufi.
Successfully set up the Python environment and worked through provided functions to develop core project components related to camera modeling and flight planning.
Developed a Python-based drone trajectory planner model, which calculated and visually represented efficient flight paths for aerial photography.
Performed regression testing to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the system, including analyzing the impact of changing parameters such as overlap, sidelap, height, and exposure time on flight plans and drone speed. Available in my Github repository at [link].
